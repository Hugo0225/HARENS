# Hardware Accelarated Redundancy Elimination in Network Systems

We have developed a Hardware Accelarated Redundancy Elimination in Network Systems (HARENS). It is a software that significantly improve the performance of redundancy elimination algorithms, through the use of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration,  hierarchical multi-threaded pipeline, single machine map-reduce, and other memory efficiency techniques to obtain an optimum performance of the redundancy elimination algorithm.

This project has been developed by [Kelu Diao](keludiao@gmail.com) and [Dr. Ioannis Papapanagiotou](ipapapa@ncsu.edu).
